# 🐍 Python Mini Projects

Welcome to my collection of beginner-friendly Python mini projects! This repository contains simple and interactive Python programs that I created to improve my programming skills and learn more about Python logic and structure.

## 📁 Projects Included

### 1. ✊✋✌️ Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
A terminal-based implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game where you can play against the computer. The program uses Python's `random` module to generate the computer's moves.

- Easy to customize or expand with new questions

### 3. 💱 Currency Converter
A console-based program that converts amounts between different currencies using predefined conversion rates.

**Features:**
- Basic user input for amount and currencies
- Hardcoded exchange rates
- Can be extended to use real-time rates via APIs in the future

These projects require Python 3.x. You can run them from the terminal or any Python IDE.

No additional libraries are needed — all are built with basic Python modules.
